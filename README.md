# Py_Correct

Py_Correct is project is an autocorrection tool which does autocorrcetion on the fly for data scientist who have to work with data that contains a large number of text data (which is prone to have a lot of spelling error or highly technical language - not commonly found in the English Language - in it). It is designed for people who work with text and in fields where highly technical language is used. It designed to enabble anyone autocorrect data in SPECIFIC COLUMNS on the fly, while they focus on the most important thing: Analysing the data and providing useful actionable information.

As a software engineer and a programmer, I'm always looking for ways to solve problems with the skills I have. I'd rather use the awesome tools that wonderful programmers have created to support us mere mortals. However, in the case where I can't find any tool that provides the exact solution I require, I will work on it until I create the new perfect shinny baby. Now, I am planning on sharing all the tools I have developed that others may benefit. As a researcher, data is one of the things that matter to me most. Data helps me tell a compelling story and get people to take the desired action. Data helps me reach conclusions with very little doubt and make informed decision.

## The Challenge 💭
As someone who works in Malaria Research (studying the ecological role of mosquitoes), I collect and analise a lot of data. The collected data, which contains a lot of scientific names and other technical terms, is often riddled with spelling mistakes. Mistakes, which the team would spend hours if not days correcting. One day, the post-doctoral fellow in charge asked if it was possible to write a script which would scan and autocorrect all the data in one go. Thus, and idea 💡 was born.

## The Idea
I there started researching PYTHON spellchecker and autocorrection libraries for such a purpose. I fell in love with PyEnchant because of the flexibility and adaptability. I fell in love in particular with the ease of creating and using your own word dictionaries. Enter Py_Correct. 

## How It works
### Coming Soon 🚧

## Example 
### Coming Soon 🚧


The seconf file in the 'data' folder with the '_corrected_' at the end of the name is the correctd file. Everything worked perfectly.

## Note
I anticipate that, depending on the level of the mistake, the orders 'Hemiptera' and 'Homoptera' may be mistaken for each other. 

That said, this is the first step to creating a library that helps with data cleaning for scientists and fellow data enthusiasts. Happy Coding 💻💕
