# Py_Correct

Py_Correct is a python script that uses PyEnchant to auto-correct data in a specific column using a predefined list of words from a .txt file.

In this case, the correction is being performed on the Temporary name column where we've intentionally spelt some insect orders wrong.

Find mistakes at index positions: 0, 8, 14, 16, 17, 18, 20, 27, 30, 31, 85

The seconf file in the 'data' folder with the '_corrected_' at the end of the name is the correctd file. Everything worked perfectly.

## Note
I anticipate that, depending on the level of the mistake, the orders 'Hemiptera' and 'Homoptera' may be mistaken for each other. 

That said, this is the first step to creating a library that helps with data cleaning for scientists and fellow data enthusiasts. Happy Coding ðŸ’»ðŸ’•
